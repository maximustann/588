\section{Conclusion}

In the project we first developed a model for serivce location-allocation problem so that it can be 
tackled by evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO). Secondly, we developed a multi-objective PSO-based 
algorithm to solve the problem. The experiments show that our algorithm is both effecient and effective than 
NSGA-II based algorithm. One of challenge is to find a proper for the value of the 
transformation threshold. There is no systematic approach to determine the optimal transformation
threshold. In order to solve this problem, we mainly consider a binary-based PSO (BPSO) approach. It is natural to apply BPSO
on a binary-based representation, therefore BPSO and NSGA-II could use the same representation. In the future, we will 
further investigate the use of binary PSO approach to Web serivce location-allocation problem.

So far we have completed the first two objectives. We are going to developed two more algorithms to tackled the probelm. A Gantt chart showing the brief plan for the rest of the project is illustrated as follows.
