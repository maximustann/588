\begin{abstract}
With the ever increasing number of functional similar Web services being available on the Internet, 
the market competition is becoming intense. 
Web service providers realized that good Quality of Service (QoS) is a key of business success
and low network latency is a critical measurement of good QoS.
Because network latency is related to geometric location,
a straightforward way to reduce network latency is to allocate services to proper locations. 
Hence, it is necessary to provide an effective Web services allocation algorithm to WSPs. 
In this project, we model the Web service location allocation 
problem as a multi-objective optimization problem that minimize overall network latency and total cost. 
We use PSO-based with aggregation approach and with a Pareto front 
approach. We further develop a new BMOPSOCD with rounding function approach to improve the quality of solutions. 
The result shows that BMOPSOCD could provide a diverse solutions which covers the whole Pareto front. 
In addition, it has a good scalability that does not affect by the problem size.
